# getting-started-with-python


The version of Python that ships with OS X is great for learning, but itâ€™s not good for development. 

Now, we can install Python 3:

```
 $ brew install python
 
 $ brew upgrade python
 
 $ python --version
```
This will take a minute or two.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).
